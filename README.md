## Running

To run the app locally you will need the latest version of **npm** and **angular-cli**. Please refer to documentation for installation details.

Before running the app, you will need to install dependencies locally. Run `npm i` from the root of application (where **package.json** is located) to install the dependencies.

To run local dev server run `ng serve` from app root. This will set up development server and deploy the app to port `4200`, so you can access it in browser using the link `http://localhost:4200`.
